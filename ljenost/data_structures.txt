data structures are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming
they define how data is organized stored and manipulated within a program understanding data structures is very important for developing efficient and effective algorithms
in this tutorial we will explore the most commonly used data structures including arrays linked lists stacks queues trees and graphs
a data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize dana
it is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently
a data structure is not only used for organizing the data it is also used for processing retrieving and storing data there are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed
so we must have good knowledge about data structures 
linear data structure is a data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements is called a linear data structure 
example array stack queue linked list etc
static data structure static data structure has a fixed memory size it is easier to access the elements in a static data structure 
example array
dynamic data structure in dynamic data structure the size is not fixed 
it can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory or space complexity of the code 
example queue stack etc
non-linear data structure data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures
in a non-linear data structure we can not traverse all the elements in a single run only 
examples trees and graphs
